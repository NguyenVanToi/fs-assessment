## About The Project - Tony Nguyen - Fullstack Assessment

## Front End - Recipe Website
- Reason: For this assessment, I chose the Recipe Website project because it allows me to demonstrate a wider range of skills essential to web application development. This includes setting up a well-structured Next.js project, handling data through API endpoints, and using Material UI components effectively. This choice highlights my proficiency in front end and back end development: layout structure, responsive design principles with MUI and data management, API integration, which are valuable, practical skills in modern web development.
- Description: 
  - The main page, Recipes, displays categories and products. Users can filter products by selected categories and view detailed recipes.
  - For unspecified pages, users are directed to a custom error page (404.tsx), providing a user-friendly experience by handling navigation errors gracefully.
